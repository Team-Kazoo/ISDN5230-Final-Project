The transformation of human vocal input into expressive instrumental sounds represents a fundamental challenge at the intersection of signal processing, human-computer interaction, and neural audio synthesis. We present Mambo Whistle, a comprehensive real-time vocal synthesis framework that achieves professional-grade audio transformation entirely within a web browser environment, eliminating the need for specialized hardware or native software installation. Our system introduces a novel hybrid architecture that strategically combines classical digital signal processing algorithms operating on a dedicated AudioWorklet thread with modern neural sequence generation through Google Magenta's MusicRNN. This architectural innovation enables the system to achieve 50--60ms end-to-end audio processing latency while simultaneously providing AI-powered harmonic accompaniment that responds intelligently to the performer's melodic input. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the robustness of our approach through 235 comprehensive automated tests covering functional correctness, and detailed performance profiling confirms real-time capability across diverse hardware configurations. The proposed framework advances the state-of-the-art in accessible music technology by demonstrating that sophisticated, low-latency audio synthesis previously achievable only through dedicated hardware can now be delivered through standard web browsers, thereby democratizing access to expressive musical instruments for users worldwide regardless of their technical resources or expertise.
